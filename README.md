Painthings is a mobile application designed to support individuals in exploring and processing their emotions through a **combination** of **art** and **journaling**. The app offers a unique and meaningful experience by allowing users to search for paintings or artworks based on specific emotions they are feeling. These selected artworks serve as prompts for journaling, helping users delve deeper into their *emotions* and *express* themselves through **writing**.

With Painthings, users can create a **digital diary** where they can save their journal entries, creating a personal record of their emotional journey. The app aims to provide accessible emotional **well-being** resources by harnessing the therapeutic benefits of art therapy and expressive writing.

According to our project plan, we have completed the development of the Android app functionality with [WikiArt Dataset]([http://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/wikiartemotions.html](http://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/wikiartemotions.html)). Here's the summary of our progress in each learning path:

|Learning Path|Completion Status|
|---|---|
|Machine Learning|100% Complete |
|Mobile Development|100% Complete |
|Cloud Computing|100% Complete |

### Learning Path Details

#### Machine Learning

In the Machine Learning learning path, we focused on building clustering models using the TensorFlow library and Scikit-Learn library. We utilized Flask to deploy the model and performed data preprocessing tasks such as normalization for the dataset and feature selection.

#### Mobile Development

For the Mobile Development learning path, we successfully implemented all planned features in the Painthings Android app. We utilized Retrofit for seamless HTTP requests, integrated Glide for efficient image loading from the internet, and incorporated shared element animations to enhance the user experience.

#### Cloud Computing

In the Cloud Computing learning path, we created APIs for user authentication, posts, and choosing paintings. We deployed the backend service and machine learning models to the Google Cloud Platform using App Engine with the help of Flask.
